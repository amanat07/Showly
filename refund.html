    <h2>Ticket Cancellation & Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      Once a movie ticket is successfully purchased on **SHOWLY**, it is generally considered **non-refundable and non-cancellable** except under the specific conditions listed below.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>**Show Cancellation:** If the movie show is officially cancelled by the cinema, a full refund for the ticket price will be processed automatically within 5-7 business days.</li>
      <li>**Technical Errors:** If an amount was debited from your account but the ticket was not issued due to a technical error, the transaction will be reversed, and a refund will be initiated immediately.</li>
      <li>**Duplicate Transaction:** In case of a duplicate successful payment for the same booking, one of the transactions will be fully refunded.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Processing Time</h2>
    <p>
      For all valid refunds, the amount will be credited back to the original payment source. The refund process typically takes **7 to 10 working days** to reflect in your bank account, depending on your bank's processing time.
